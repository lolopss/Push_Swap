# Push_Swap
Ecole42 project.
The goal of this project is to make an algorithm to sort numbers.
For that we will have 2 lists : list a and b.
I used radix algorithm, for which i needed to understand how bits and their operators (&, >>, <<, ...)
I learned a lot about chained lists thanks to this project
